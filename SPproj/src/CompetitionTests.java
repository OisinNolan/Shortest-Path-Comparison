 * Discussion of Assignment:
 * 
 * Data structure used to store graph is a 2d array, ie a matrix.
 * Each element in the matrix, (u,v) where u, v are nodes, stores the cost
 * associated with the edge linking u to v. If (u,v) = 0, there does not exist
 * an edge from u to v.
 * 
 * This data structure was chosen because:
 * 	- it is easy to use and intuitive
 * 	- storage of edges is ideal for adjacency in directed graphs,
 * 	  i.e (u,v) does not necessarily equal (v,u).
 * 	- Not as efficient as adjacency list, however the file is small enough that
 * 	  this was not taken into consideration.
 * 
 * Differences between Floyd-Warshall and Dijkstra:
